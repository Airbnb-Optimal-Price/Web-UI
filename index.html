          Before this app I always had a hard time making a listing for my AirBnb. Let alone choosing a price per night. With this app I am able to put my listing info in my profile. Then in seconds it tells me the optimal price for my listing in my area. No more guess work on if I am listing a fair price for my guest, and me.

          So here I am on my trip I get to my hotel, and they tell me there was a booking error. So now I don't have a room to stay in during my trip. The hotel reccommends getting an AirBnB. So I look and I am just overwhelmed with all the choices, and if I am getting it for a good price. A friend told me about this app. So I tried it out, and in seconds I was able to find, and book an AirBnB for a great price. I highly reccomend using this app to help you find an AirBnB.
